Global variables:
	1. int total --> used to count times required to win the game
	2. int SIZE --> defines the length of bingo card rows and columns
	3. int direction --> used to define what directional type of win we have

Methods:
1. fillCard:
	Void method that is passed array list, initialized in main. 
	Array list is generated using the input from the
	bingo.in file included in the source directory. 
	
2. printCard:
	Void method that prints the bingo card in
    its original, unmodified state. Card is the
    previously generated (from bingo.in) array
    that is printed to the user's screen.
	
3. playGame:
	Void method that is passed array card,
    initializes the ArrayList 'bin,'
	and generates random values that are used to
	fill out the bingo card. Bin is printed along with
	number of random integers it took to win the game.
	
4. checkForWin:
	Returns a boolean value determining whether a general win
    has been achieved. Array card and arrayList bin are evaluated
    to determine equality of each element. For each equal element,
    a string "X" displaces the current card integer. New card
    showing matches is printed.
	
5. checkForDirection:
	Returns boolean value determining whether directional win
    has been achieved. Array card is evaluated for directional
    win. Global integer 'direction' is also set based on the type of win.
	
6. directionSwitch:
	Uses global integer 'direction'
    (value is set in checkForDirection)
    to print what type of win was achieved
