Methods:
1. inputBooks:
Integer returning method that is
    passed the user-selected file name called 'inputFile'
    and an empty LibraryBook ArrayList called 'books'
    as parameters. The inputFile is scanned for
    title names, author names, copyright dates, prices,
    and genres, and each line of the file is used to
    create a new LibraryBook with these given characteristics.
    The ArrayList is filled with the newly defined LibraryBooks.

2. printRecord:
Void method that prints all characteristics
    of a book using the LibraryBook ArrayList 'books' and the
    integer 'location' of the book.

3. sortBooks:
Void method that is passed an ArrayList of
    LibraryBooks 'books' and an integer number of books,
    'numBooks.' Using a selection sort, the books are
    sorted by title.

4. welcomeScreen:
String returning method that prints out a welcome menu
    for the program. This method also scans the current
    directory for data-containing files (.dat) and prints
    them below the welcome screen. Finally, the user inputs the
    chosen file name, and the method returns the user selection.

5. printMenu:
Void method that is passed a LibraryBook ArrayList 'books'
    and an integer number of books 'numBooks.' The menu for the
    program is printed to the user's screen, and the
    userSelection method is called for the user to select which
    action he would like to take.

6. userSelection:
Void method that is passed a LibraryBook ArrayList 'books'
    and an integer value of the number of books, 'numBooks.'
    A scanner object receives the user's selection from the
    main menu, and a switch statement is used to determine which
    method should be called next.

7.searchAllBooks:
Integer returning method that is passed a LibraryBook
    ArrayList of 'books,' a String 'bookTitle,' and an
    integer number of books 'numBooks.' Using a binary search,
    the ArrayList is scanned for the bookTitle that is input by the user
    in the searchBook method.

8. searchBook:
Void method that is passed a LibraryBook
    ArrayList of 'books' and the integer 'numBooks.'
    A title is input by the user and the searchAllBooks
    method is called to search the ArrayList books for the title.

9. displayRecords: 
Void method that is passed the ArrayList books and
    the integer number of books and prints a card using
    the printRecord method to show the user the information
    about a selected book.

10. clearScreen:
Void method that prints a line of bash
    magic to clear the screen of any text.
